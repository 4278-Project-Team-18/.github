# BIO Club Web Application

The “Books I Own” (BIO) service organization at Case Western Reserve University connects volunteering college students to underprivileged elementary school students in the Cleveland area through personalized book donations. For our group’s project, we plan to design and implement a web application that would serve as an online system for all of the organization’s data transfers and processes. 
Currently, BIO maintains all of its information about volunteers, teachers, students, and orders in a master spreadsheet while conducting communication via email. Besides the current spreadsheet managing the organization’s data, there are no competitors to our product as it is created to meet the specific needs of this organization. With our web application, there would be an organized single source of information, separated for ease of use by administrators, volunteers, and teachers.
